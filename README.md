# Genetics

Example project for my generic genetic algorithm class (Travelling sales person problem)

#Features
Generic genetic algorithm class    
Crossover    
Mutation    
Fittest survive    
variable population size and iteration count

#Known Issues   
It takes to much iterations to find better "solutions" (crossover and mutation needs some improvements)
